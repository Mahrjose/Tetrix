# **Project Name: Tetrix**

### **Description**
A vibrant Tetris-inspired game where falling blocks and strategic power-ups collide, made entirely using OpenGL, C++, and GL_POINTS.


## **Features**
1. **Falling Blocks:** Blocks continuously fall from the top of the grid.
2. **Player Controls:** Use keyboard inputs to move blocks left, right, or rotate them.
3. **Line Clearing:** Complete rows are detected and cleared, with the remaining blocks shifting down.
4. **Varied Blocks:** Blocks come in different colors and shapes.
5. **Scoreboard:** Tracks your score in real-time.
6. **Power-Ups and Traps:** Randomized blocks with special effects to add variety.


## **Technologies Used**
- **OpenGL**: For rendering graphics.
- **C++**: Core game logic and structure.
- **GLEW**: For managing OpenGL extensions.
- **GL_POINTS**: Used exclusively for rendering all game visuals.


## **How to Build and Run**

### **Prerequisites**
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- OpenGL development libraries
- GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)

### **Steps to Build**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahrjose/Tetrix.git
   cd GridFall
   ```
2. Compile and Run the code:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

## **Controls**
- **Arrow Keys**:
  - Left: Move block left
  - Right: Move block right
  - Up: Rotate block
- **Spacebar**: Instantly drop the block


## **Gameplay**
- Blocks will fall from the top of the grid.
- Use arrow keys to position and rotate the blocks.
- Complete rows to clear them and score points.
- Watch out for random power-ups and traps that change gameplay dynamics.
